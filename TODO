 + split selection path and store only relevant parts on individual documents
 + avoid cloning tree nodes (and similar) just for indentation/coloring/etc purposes
 + fix navigation in common lisp references, it's broken due to recent selection split
 - change context sensitive help to display available but inaccessible commands too
 - make context sensitive help less fragile wrt. how operations are computed
 - implement key seqeuence gestures, add key gesture prefix parameters to projections
 - rename projections to <name>@<source-type>-><destination-type>? (e.g. syntax@json/array->syntax/node)
 + add workbench editor/navigator/console parts
 - searching/search->graphics/canvas projection is plain wrong
 + current get-selection implementation kills laziness, pattern-matching selections is also bad for laziness
 - replace Nthcdr calls in selection computations with chomp-selection
 - separate direct common lisp from more intentional document data structures, introduce new projections
